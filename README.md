# 3d bar chart

It's mostly basically a toy. I'd been wanting to build this kind of chart for years, and I finally just sat down to see if I could do it.

Docs? What are those? You're welcome to play with it and get it wired up properly. Just look in App.js to see what you need to give the
3d chart object. Maybe I'll document it later.
